# Development details

## CRUSTDE - Containerized Rust Development Environment

I recommend using the CRUSTDE - Containerized Rust Development Environment to write Rust projects. Follow the instructions here <https://github.com/CRUSTDE-ContainerizedRustDevEnv/crustde_cnt_img_pod>.  

It is an isolated development environment that will not mess with you system.
It will work on Linux (tested on Debian) and inside WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

You just need to install the newer alternative to Docker: [podman](https://podman.io/). Then you download the prepared container image from DockerHub (3GB). And then a little juggling with ssh keys. All this is simplified by running a few bash scripts. Just follow the easy instructions.  

The container image contains cargo, rustc, wasm-pack, basic-http-server, cargo-auto and other utils that a Rust project needs.  

## Workflow with automation_tasks_rs and cargo-auto

For easy workflow, use the automation tasks that are already coded in the sub-project `automation_tasks_rs`. This is a basic workflow:

```bash
cargo auto build
cargo auto release
cargo auto win_release
cargo auto doc
cargo auto test
cargo auto commit_and push
cargo auto github_new_release
```

Every task finishes with instructions how to proceed.  
The [cargo-auto](https://github.com/automation-tasks-rs/cargo-auto) and [dev_bestia_cargo_completion](https://github.com/automation-tasks-rs/dev_bestia_cargo_completion) are already installed inside the CRUSTDE container.

You can open the automation sub-project in VSCode and then code your own tasks in Rust.

```bash
code automation_tasks_rs
```
